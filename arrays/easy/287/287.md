Certainly! Here's the code with step-by-step explanations in Markdown format:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                return nums[i]
        return -1
```

Explanation:

The code finds duplicates in a list of numbers using the following steps:

1. The code starts by importing the necessary module (`typing`) and the `List` type hint.

2. The `Solution` class is defined, which contains the `findDuplicate` method.

3. Inside the `findDuplicate` method, the `nums` list is sorted using the `sort` method. This step is important for detecting duplicates efficiently.

4. A loop is started using the `range` function, which iterates from 1 to the length of `nums`. The loop variable `i` represents the current index.

5. Inside the loop, the code compares the current element `nums[i]` with the previous element `nums[i-1]`. If they are equal, it means a duplicate has been found, and the code returns that duplicate number using `return nums[i]`.

6. If no duplicates are found after iterating through all the elements, the code returns -1 to indicate that no duplicates exist in the given list.

Here's an example usage of the `findDuplicate` method:

```python
nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]
solution = Solution()
duplicate = solution.findDuplicate(nums)
print("Duplicate number:", duplicate)
```

Output:
```
Duplicate number: 2
```

In this example, the `nums` list contains numbers with one duplicate (2). The `findDuplicate` method is called with the `nums` list, and it returns the duplicate number, which is 2 in this case. The code then prints the duplicate number.
