Here's a point-wise explanation of the code with corresponding code snippets in Python:

1. The code defines a class named `Solution` that contains a method named `findDuplicate`.
   
   ```python
   class Solution:
       def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
   ```

2. The algorithm used in the method is Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm for cycle detection in a linked list.
   
   ```python
   # Using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm
   # to detect the cycle in the linked list
   ```

3. Initialize two variables, `tortoise` and `hare`, with the first element of the `nums` list.
   
   ```python
   tortoise = nums[0]
   hare = nums[0]
   ```

4. Move the `tortoise` and `hare` until they meet within the cycle.
   
   ```python
   while True:
       tortoise = nums[tortoise]
       hare = nums[nums[hare]]
       if tortoise == hare:
           break
   ```

5. Reset the `tortoise` to the start of the list.
   
   ```python
   tortoise = nums[0]
   ```

6. Move the `tortoise` and `hare` at the same speed until they meet again at the duplicate number.
   
   ```python
   while tortoise != hare:
       tortoise = nums[tortoise]
       hare = nums[hare]
   ```

7. Return the duplicate number found by the algorithm.
   
   ```python
   return tortoise
   ```

The complete code is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm
        # to detect the cycle in the linked list
        tortoise = nums[0]
        hare = nums[0]
        
        # Move tortoise and hare until they meet
        while True:
            tortoise = nums[tortoise]
            hare = nums[nums[hare]]
            if tortoise == hare:
                break
        
        # Reset tortoise to the start of the list
        tortoise = nums[0]
        
        # Move tortoise and hare at the same speed until they meet again
        while tortoise != hare:
            tortoise = nums[tortoise]
            hare = nums[hare]
        
        # Return the duplicate number
        return tortoise
```

The code assumes that there is at least one duplicate number in the `nums` list. If there are no duplicates or the input list is empty, the behavior of the code is not defined.
