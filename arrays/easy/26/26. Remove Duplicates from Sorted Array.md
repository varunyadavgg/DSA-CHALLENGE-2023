Here's the Markdown format of the code explanation:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        i = 0

        while(i < n-1):
            if nums[i] == nums[i+1]:
                nums.pop(i)
                n -= 1
                i -= 1
            
            i += 1
```

## Code Explanation

The above code defines a class `Solution` with a method `removeDuplicates` that takes a list of numbers `nums` as a parameter. The goal of the method is to remove any duplicates from the list.

1. Initialize a variable `n` with the length of the `nums` list.
2. Initialize a variable `i` with a value of 0.
3. Enter a `while` loop that iterates until `i` is less than `n-1`.
4. Inside the loop, check if the current element `nums[i]` is equal to the next element `nums[i+1]`.
5. If there is a duplicate, remove the element at index `i` using the `pop` method, which also decreases the value of `n` by 1.
6. Decrement `i` by 1 to account for the removed element.
7. Increment `i` by 1 to move to the next element in the list.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the loop condition `i < n-1` is no longer satisfied.
9. Once the loop exits, the `nums` list will have all duplicates removed.
