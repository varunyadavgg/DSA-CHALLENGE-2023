Here's the code with step-by-step explanations and corresponding code snippets:

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        min_price = float('inf')

        for price in prices:
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
            elif price - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = price - min_price

        return max_profit
```

Explanation:

1. The code begins by importing the necessary module (`typing`) and the `List` type hint.

2. The `Solution` class is defined, which contains the `maxProfit` method.

3. Inside the `maxProfit` method, two variables are initialized:
   - `max_profit` is set to 0 initially to keep track of the maximum profit.
   - `min_price` is set to positive infinity (`float('inf')`) initially to keep track of the minimum price seen so far.

4. A loop is started to iterate through each `price` in the `prices` list.

5. Inside the loop, the code checks if the current `price` is less than the current `min_price`. If it is, the `min_price` is updated to the current `price`, indicating a potential new buying opportunity.

   ```python
   if price < min_price:
       min_price = price
   ```

6. If the current `price` minus `min_price` is greater than the current `max_profit`, it means a better selling opportunity has been found. The code updates the `max_profit` accordingly.

   ```python
   elif price - min_price > max_profit:
       max_profit = price - min_price
   ```

7. After iterating through all the `prices`, the code returns the final `max_profit`.

   ```python
   return max_profit
   ```

The code follows these steps to find the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling the stock based on the given prices. It keeps track of the minimum price seen so far and calculates the difference between the current price and the minimum price to update the maximum profit.
