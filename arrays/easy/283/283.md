Here's the code with proper explanations:

```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        zero_count = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == 0:
                zero_count += 1
            else:
                # Move the non-zero element to the left
                nums[i-zero_count], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[i-zero_count]
```

Explanation:

The code is implementing the "Move Zeroes" problem. The goal is to move all the zeros in a given list of numbers (`nums`) to the end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `Solution` class is defined, which contains the `moveZeroes` method.

2. The method does not return anything and modifies the `nums` list in-place.

3. A variable `zero_count` is initialized to keep track of the number of zeros encountered.

4. A loop iterates through each element of the `nums` list using the `range(len(nums))` construct.

5. If the current element (`nums[i]`) is equal to 0, it means we have encountered a zero. In that case, we increment the `zero_count` variable.

6. If the current element is non-zero, we need to move it to the left side of the list. We achieve this by swapping the current element with the element `zero_count` positions to the left. This effectively moves the non-zero element towards the left while maintaining the relative order of other non-zero elements.

7. At the end of the loop, all the zeros will be shifted to the right end of the list, while the non-zero elements remain in their original order.

The code modifies the `nums` list in-place, moving all the zeros to the end while preserving the order of the non-zero elements.
