Sure! Here's the explanation of the provided code in Markdown format:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        numToIndex = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if target - nums[i] in numToIndex:
                return [numToIndex[target - nums[i]], i]
            numToIndex[nums[i]] = i
        return []
```

This code defines a class named `Solution` with a method called `twoSum`. The purpose of this method is to find two numbers from the `nums` list that add up to the given `target` value.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary called `numToIndex`. This dictionary will store the numbers from the `nums` list as keys and their corresponding indices as values.

2. Iterate over the `nums` list using a `for` loop and the `range` function. The loop variable `i` represents the index of the current element.

3. Inside the loop, check if the difference between the `target` value and the current `nums[i]` is already present in the `numToIndex` dictionary. This is done using the `if` statement `target - nums[i] in numToIndex`.

4. If the difference is found in `numToIndex`, it means we have already encountered a number earlier in the list that can be added to the current number to reach the target. In this case, return a list containing the indices of these two numbers: `[numToIndex[target - nums[i]], i]`.

5. If the difference is not found in `numToIndex`, it means the current number has not been encountered before. Add the current number (`nums[i]`) as a key to the `numToIndex` dictionary, with its corresponding index (`i`) as the value.

6. After the loop ends, if no two numbers are found that add up to the target, return an empty list `[]`.

This code has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` list, because it iterates over the list only once. The space complexity is also O(n) because the `numToIndex` dictionary can potentially store all the elements from the `nums` list.
