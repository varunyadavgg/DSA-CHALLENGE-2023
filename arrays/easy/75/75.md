Here's a Markdown explanation of the code you provided:


This code implements the Dutch National Flag algorithm to sort an array of colors represented by integers 0, 1, and 2. It rearranges the elements in such a way that all 0s appear before 1s, and all 1s appear before 2s.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The code defines a class named `Solution` that contains a method named `sortColors`.

   ```python
   class Solution(object):
       def sortColors(self, nums):
   ```

2. Initialize three variables: `left` represents the index where the next 0 should be placed, `right` represents the index where the next 2 should be placed, and `current` represents the current index being processed.

   ```python
   left = 0
   right = len(nums) - 1
   current = 0
   ```

3. Enter a loop that continues until the `current` index surpasses or reaches the `right` index.

   ```python
   while current <= right:
   ```

4. If the element at the `current` index is 0, swap it with the element at the `left` index. Move both the `left` and `current` indices forward by one.

   ```python
   if nums[current] == 0:
       nums[current], nums[left] = nums[left], nums[current]
       left += 1
       current += 1
   ```

5. If the element at the `current` index is 2, swap it with the element at the `right` index. Move the `right` index backward by one. Note that we don't increment the `current` index in this case because the swapped element from the `right` index could be 0 or 2, and it needs further processing.

   ```python
   elif nums[current] == 2:
       nums[current], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[current]
       right -= 1
   ```

6. If the element at the `current` index is 1, leave it in place and increment the `current` index.

   ```python
   else:
       current += 1
   ```

The algorithm ensures that all 0s are moved to the left side of the array, all 2s are moved to the right side, and the remaining 1s naturally fall into place in the middle.

The code does not return any value but modifies the `nums` array in-place.

Here's the complete code:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        current = 0
        
        while current <= right:
            if nums[current] == 0:
                nums[current], nums[left] = nums[left], nums[current]
                left += 1
                current += 1
            elif nums[current] == 2:
                nums[current], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[current]
                right -= 1
            else:
                current += 1
```
