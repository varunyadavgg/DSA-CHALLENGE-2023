## Code Explanation

The given code defines a class named `Solution` with a method `maxProfit`. This method takes a list of integers `prices` as input and returns the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling stocks.

The variable `profit` is initialized to 0, representing the current profit. The code then iterates over the `prices` list starting from the second element (`i = 1`) using a for loop.

For each iteration, it compares the current price (`prices[i]`) with the previous price (`prices[i - 1]`). If the current price is higher than the previous price, it means a profit can be made by buying at the previous price and selling at the current price. In this case, the difference between the current and previous prices is added to the `profit` variable.

Finally, the `profit` value is returned as the result.

## Code Snippet

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
        return profit
```

## Example Usage

```python
solution = Solution()
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
max_profit = solution.maxProfit(prices)
print(max_profit)
```

Output:
```
7
```

In the given example, the `prices` list represents the stock prices on different days. The maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling stocks is 7.
