Here's the code with proper explanations:

```python
# 73. Set Matrix Zeroes
from typing import List

class Solution:

    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        # Step 1: Initialize sets to store the rows and columns with zeros
        zero_rows = set()
        zero_cols = set()

        # Step 2: Iterate through the matrix to find the rows and columns with zeros
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    zero_rows.add(i)
                    zero_cols.add(j)

        # Step 3: Set the elements in zero rows to zero
        for i in zero_rows:
            for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
                matrix[i][j] = 0

        # Step 4: Set the elements in zero columns to zero
        for j in zero_cols:
            for i in range(len(matrix)):
                matrix[i][j] = 0
```

Explanation:

The code is implementing the "Set Matrix Zeroes" problem. The goal is to modify a given matrix in-place such that if any element in the matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `Solution` class is defined, which will contain the `setZeroes` method.

2. In Step 1, two sets `zero_rows` and `zero_cols` are initialized. These sets will be used to store the row and column indices that contain zeros.

3. In Step 2, a nested loop iterates through each element of the matrix. If an element is found to be 0, its row index `i` and column index `j` are added to the respective sets `zero_rows` and `zero_cols`.

4. In Step 3, another loop iterates through each row index `i` in `zero_rows`. For each row, a nested loop iterates through the columns of that row, setting all elements to 0.

5. In Step 4, a similar process is done for each column index `j` in `zero_cols`. A loop iterates through each row, setting the element at `(i, j)` to 0.

The code modifies the original matrix in-place, ensuring that all rows and columns containing 0 are completely set to 0.
